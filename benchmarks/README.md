# Benchmarks

These are the code and logs for benchmarking work on this library.

The 2.0.0 release will be much faster!

Numbers are runs per second on Brian's MacBook Pro (2017, 3.1 Ghz Quad-Core Intel Core i7 with 16GB memory) in Chrome (latest at time of writing.)

- [benchmarking the parser](./parser.md)
- [benchmarking lists vs arrays](./lists-vs-arrays.md)

All the benchmark code lives under `src/` in this directory.
