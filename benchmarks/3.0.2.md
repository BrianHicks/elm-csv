# 3.0.2 Benchmarks

I was benchmarking some other stuff in different browsers and got curious how `elm-csv` performed.
(Setup: same as in [parser.md](./parser.md) except with only the 16-row case.)

| Browser              |   Split |   Parse | % Change |
|----------------------|--------:|--------:|----------|
| Chrome 88.0.4324.192 | 147,967 |  88,501 |  -40.19% |
| Firefox 86.0         | 198,989 |  55,016 |  -72.35% |
| Safari 14.0.1        | 195,194 | 194,489 |   -0.36% |

This rings true based on the other benchmarks I'm doing!
I expect that if I rewrote the parser to use `String.beginsWith` instead of `String.slice`, we could maybe see no change in Chrome, a modest improvement in Firefox, and a massive loss in Safari.
BUT this would maybe be offset by having to slice the string on every iteration *anyway*, so probably not worth doing.
